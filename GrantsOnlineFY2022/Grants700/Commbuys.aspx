<u><b>COMMBUYS Grant Information</b></u><br /><br />
<b>Get Notified When Grants are Posted in COMMBUYS</b><br />
A recent enhancement to COMMBUYS, the State's procurement system, enables registered organizations to receive email notifications of Grants* posted in the COMMBUYS Market Center. 
<br /><br />
To automatically receive these notifications, organizations need to establish a Vendor Profile in COMMBUYS - an action that takes a few minutes to complete and has no associated cost - and select the UNSPSC commodity code assigned to Grants (00-00-00).**

Use of COMMBUYS to receive electronic quotes for grant opportunities is optional; however, state agencies are encouraged to require grantees to register and submit quotes (applications) through COMMBUYS, which provides a central repository for receipt of electronic applications. As more grantees use COMMBUYS to identify grant opportunities, they will have a single location to apply for grants from multiple state agencies, resulting in efficiencies for both the grantees and the state agencies.

**This United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC) is specific to Massachusetts and COMMBUYS, so no information about the code will be available on UNSPSC websites. As this is a new feature, interested organizations also may wish to conduct additional searches to find Grants prior to this enhancement. Using the <b>Advanced Search</b> feature, enter the word "Grant" in the <b>Bid Description</b> field, or narrow searches by selecting specific agencies from the <b>Organization</b> drop-down menu.
